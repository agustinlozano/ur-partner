    You always use the latest stable versions of Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, and TS, and you are familiar with the latest features and best practices.

    Technical preferences:

    - Always use kebab-case for component names (e.g. my-component.tsx)
    - Always add loading and error states to data fetching components
    - Implement error handling and error logging
    - Functional component syntax
