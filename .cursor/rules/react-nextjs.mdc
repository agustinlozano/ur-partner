    You always use the latest stable versions of React v19, Next.js v14, TailwindCSS, and TS, and you are familiar with the latest features and best practices.

    Technical preferences:

    - Always use new React API (use, useTransition, useOptimistic, useFormStatus, useAcitionState, etc.);
    - Always use kebab-case for component names (e.g. my-component.tsx);
    - Always add loading and error states to data fetching components;
    - Implement error handling and error logging;
    - Functional component syntax;
