## Technical Architecture

### API Overview

UR Partner is built on a modern serverless architecture using Next.js API routes and AWS services for scalability and real-time functionality.

#### Core API Endpoints

- **`POST /api/rooms`** - Create a new room with user details and personality
- **`GET /api/room-info/[roomId]`** - Get room information and current status
- **`POST /api/room/[roomId]/reveal`** - Trigger the reveal process when both users are ready
- **`POST /api/room/[roomId]/update-ready`** - Mark user as ready for reveal
- **`POST /api/room/[roomId]/upload-images`** - Handle personality image uploads
- **`POST /api/room/[roomId]/leave`** - Handle user leaving the room

#### Real-Time Communication


The app uses **WebSocket connections** through AWS Lambda for instant messaging and status updates:

- WebSocket Gateway URL for real-time room communication
- Automatic reconnection handling for robust connections

##### WebSocket Message Events

All real-time interactions are handled via structured WebSocket messages. Here are the supported event types:

| Event Type           | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `category_fixed`     | A user fixed a category                         |
| `category_completed` | A user completed a category                     |
| `progress_updated`   | A user's progress was updated                   |
| `is_ready`           | A user marked themselves as ready               |
| `say`                | A user sent a chat message                      |
| `ping`               | Keep-alive or connection check                  |
| `leave`              | A user left the room                            |

Each event includes the user's slot (`a` or `b`), and some include additional data (like `category`, `progress`, or `message`).

#### Data Storage

**Amazon DynamoDB** serves as the primary database with a flexible schema:

- **Room Management**: Stores room metadata, user slots (A/B), and session state
- **User Data**: Names, emojis, personality roles, and readiness status
- **Personality System**: Animal, place, and plant preferences for each user
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

#### Upload System

Multi-layer image upload architecture:

1. **Frontend** uploads through Next.js API routes
2. **Rate Limiting Lambda** checks upload permissions
3. **Upload Lambda** processes and stores images in S3
4. **DynamoDB** updates room data with image references

#### Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for modern React development
- **AWS SDK** for DynamoDB and S3 integration
- **Serverless Framework** for local WebSocket development
- **TypeScript** for type safety across the entire stack
- **Vercel Firewall** for rate limiting and security
